# Netflix Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of Netflix content using SQL and Python. The analysis focuses on exploring various trends and patterns within the Netflix dataset. The results of this analysis are presented through various files, including SQL queries, Python scripts, and a PowerPoint presentation.

## Files Included

- **Netflix Data Analysis.pptx**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings of the data analysis.
- **Netflix queries with output.pdf**: A PDF document containing the SQL queries used in the analysis along with their outputs.
- **SQL Code.sql**: The SQL script containing all the queries used for the analysis.
- **netflix.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis, containing information about Netflix content.
- **python.py**: A Python script used for additional data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset

The `netflix.csv` file contains the following columns:
- `show_id`: Unique ID for each show
- `type`: Type of content (Movie/TV Show)
- `title`: Title of the show
- `director`: Director of the show
- `cast`: Cast of the show
- `country`: Country where the show was produced
- `date_added`: Date when the show was added to Netflix
- `release_year`: Release year of the show
- `rating`: Rating of the show
- `duration`: Duration of the show
- `listed_in`: Genre of the show
- `description`: Description of the show

## Analysis and Results

The analysis focuses on several key aspects:
1. **Content Type Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
2. **Release Year Trends**: Exploring trends in the release years of Netflix content.
3. **Top Directors and Actors**: Identifying the most frequent directors and actors in the dataset.
4. **Country-wise Distribution**: Examining the distribution of Netflix content across different countries.
5. **Genre Analysis**: Analyzing the genres of content available on Netflix.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **SQL Queries**: The SQL queries used for the analysis are provided in the `SQL Code.sql` file. You can run these queries on any SQL-compatible database system.
2. **Python Script**: The `python.py` script contains additional data manipulation and analysis using Python. To run the script, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.).
